<p><em>Royal Mail | GBI</em><br/>
May 2018 -- November 2018, London, UK</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I was part of Data Engineering team. I developed Data Platform and data algorithms on it which transformed the whole business and allowed releasing multiple great products. I advised and recommended best practices in Scala, Agile and Software Development, Architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I implemented opt-1, opt-2 and opt-3 heuristic to solve VRP (Vehicle routing problem). This algorithm was essential for Royal Mail business, as it is unpractical to solve this task manually. Thanks to this algorithm another project &quot;Late Arrival Packages&quot; was able to kick off.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I developed parcel delivery project which processed terabytes of data in a few hours. I was responsible for productionizing (porting from POC Python code to Scala) and implemented new features for Machine Learning modules: Train, Test, Post-process and Formatter. This project was able to predict 90% of all packages UK-wide with 2-hour precision.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tech stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scala (main production language), Python (PoC)</li>
<li>Apache Spark (Spark SQL), Yarn, HDFS, Linux, Apache Zeppelin,</li>
<li>TDD, Kubernetes, Docker, Akka-HTTP, MongoDB, Cats</li>
<li>On-premise Cloud</li>

<p><em>IHS Markit | Risk Factor Utility (FRTB)</em><br/>
September 2017 -- May 2018, London, UK</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I productionized Spark application on AWS (S3, EC2, EMR) with strong automatization requirement via Ansible and CloudFormation. Due to this change deployment across environments was consistent and automated, so everybody on the team could do this by clicking one button in Jenkins.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I was part of the team which implemented very popular, and in-demand project required transforming the significant amount of raw market data into FRTB-compliant risk factors and scenarios by using DSL language for risk modelling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I helped developing functional Scala project, which the main module was a custom DSL language used by Quants. Thanks to this feature, our quants were able to produce FRTB solutions presented for multiple banks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tech stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scala, Cats, Monix Tasks, Apache Spark, Hadoop, Cassandra</li>
<li>AWS (EC2, S3), Cloud Computing, EMR, Yarn</li>

<ul>
<li><p>vCharge was a startup acquired by Ovo Energy. The idea was to control storage heaters installed in people homes. I worked with the owner, who was located in the US (~ daily one-to-one online meetings). I had a high impact on stakeholders. Throughout a couple of months, I was the only Scala developer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I built a module to forecasting Energy prices using the Dijkstra algorithm and mathematical model created by Data Scientists. It allowed buying energy cheaper and &quot;store&quot; in the customers&#39; storage heaters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tech Stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scala, Python, Akka, Play Framework, Lagom Framework, CQRS / Event Sourcing, Cassandra</li>
